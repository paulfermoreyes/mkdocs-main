# Aggregated Samples Documentation

Welcome to the **mkdocs-main**! 👋

This documentation is automatically generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and showcases a working setup that:

- Pulls **files from multiple external repositories**
- Puts them to `docs/` folder
- Uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the site
- Publishes the final result to **GitHub Pages**

---

## 🔗 Purpose

This site serves as a sample deployment for teams or individuals looking to:

- Maintain a central documentation hub
- Fetch and unify structured data (like JSON configs or metadata) from different repositories
- Automate documentation generation and hosting

---

## 📁 Source Repositories

This site aggregates content from several external repositories such as:

- `mkdocs-main`
- `mkdocs-sub1`
- `mkdocs-sub2`

---

## 📝 Customize Me!

You can update this page (`docs/index.md`) to reflect your actual documentation goals and project details.
